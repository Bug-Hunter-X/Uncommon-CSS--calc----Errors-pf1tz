The corrected code addresses the issues by:

1. Removing unnecessary spaces in `calc()` expressions around arithmetic operators.
2. Ensuring unit compatibility within the calculations.
3. Carefully structuring nested expressions and variable usage to maintain a clear calculation order and consistent units.

Here's the corrected CSS:
```css
.box {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}

:root {
  --width: 50%;
}

.box {
  width: calc((100vw - 50px) * var(--width)); /*Corrected Nested Calc and variable usage*/
}
```
