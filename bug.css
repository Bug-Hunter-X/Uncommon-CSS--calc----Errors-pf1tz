The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, sometimes, unexpected behavior occurs because of the spaces used in `calc()` expressions.  For example, the following code will not work as expected:
```css
.box {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
}
```
This is because there should be no spaces around the `-` operator.

Another less common issue is related to using `calc()` with multiple units.  While it supports mixing units (like `px` and `%`), unexpected results can arise if the units are not compatible or if the order of operations isn't carefully considered.

Finally, an uncommon, but tricky bug can occur when using `calc()` inside of nested calculations or with variables. The calculation order and unit compatibility must be very precise.
```css
:root {
  --width: 50%;
}

.box {
  width: calc(calc(100vw - 50px) * var(--width)); /*Nested Calc and variable usage*/
}
```
